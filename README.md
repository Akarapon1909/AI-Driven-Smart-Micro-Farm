ðŸŒ± Smart Microgreen Farming Platform
AI-Driven Light Recipe Control for Urban Agriculture
A humanâ€“AI collaborative farming platform.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project presents a modular, low-cost, and intelligent plant farming system designed for use in space-constrained urban settings, such as condominiums. The system integrates:
Spectrum-adjustable grow lights
Automated irrigation and ventilation
Environmental sensing
Edge AI for light recipe generation
Time-lapseâ€“based growth monitoring
The project demonstrates how AI can co-design and co-operate with humans to create an autonomous microgreen farming solution using commercially available components in Thailand.

ðŸ”§ Hardware Components
All components were selected based on local availability and cost-effectiveness in Southeast Asia. The system includes:
Component	Description
-  Raspberry Pi	Edge controller, camera & image processing
-  ESP32	Sensor and actuator control (MicroPython)
- Grow Light Assembly	6-channel spectrum-adjustable LED array
- RS485 Soil Sensor	Moisture sensing
- SHT31, BH1750	Temp, humidity, and light sensing
- Mist Nozzles + Solenoids	Automated fog and watering
- Pi Camera	Image capture every hour

ðŸŒ¿ Dataset Overview: AI-Assisted Microgreen Cultivation
This data repository supports the development of a smart microgreen farming platform by integrating sensor data acquisition, visual monitoring, and AI-assisted control. In this experiment, microgreens are cultivated under controlled indoor conditions, and a suite of sensors continuously monitors soil moisture, air temperature, relative humidity, and ambient light intensity. Simultaneously, a camera module captures real-scene time-lapse images of plant growth at hourly intervals.
The collected multimodal data are then analyzed by an AI model, which generates adaptive control strategiesâ€”specifically tailored light recipes, watering intervals, and mist cyclesâ€”based on both environmental feedback and growth stage classification. This humanâ€“AI collaborative workflow enables a dynamic and data-driven approach to urban farming, optimizing resource use and enhancing crop yield within compact living spaces.
