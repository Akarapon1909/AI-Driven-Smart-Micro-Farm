ðŸŒ± Smart Microgreen Farming Platform
AI-Driven Light Recipe Control for Urban Agriculture
A humanâ€“AI collaborative farming platform.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project presents a modular, low-cost, and intelligent plant farming system designed for use in space-constrained urban settings, such as condominiums. The system integrates:
Spectrum-adjustable grow lights
Automated irrigation and ventilation
Environmental sensing
Edge AI for light recipe generation
Time-lapseâ€“based growth monitoring
The project demonstrates how AI can co-design and co-operate with humans to create an autonomous microgreen farming solution using commercially available components in Thailand.
