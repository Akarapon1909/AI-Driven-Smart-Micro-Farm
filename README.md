ðŸŒ± Smart Microgreen Farming Platform
AI-Driven Light Recipe Control for Urban Agriculture
A humanâ€“AI collaborative farming platform.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project presents a modular, low-cost, and intelligent plant farming system designed for use in space-constrained urban settings, such as condominiums. The system integrates:
Spectrum-adjustable grow lights
Automated irrigation and ventilation
Environmental sensing
Edge AI for light recipe generation
Time-lapseâ€“based growth monitoring
The project demonstrates how AI can co-design and co-operate with humans to create an autonomous microgreen farming solution using commercially available components in Thailand.

ðŸ”§ Hardware Components
All components were selected based on local availability and cost-effectiveness in Southeast Asia. The system includes:
Component	Description
Raspberry Pi	Edge controller, camera & image processing
ESP32	Sensor and actuator control (MicroPython)
Grow Light Assembly	6-channel spectrum-adjustable LED array
RS485 Soil Sensor	Moisture sensing
SHT31, BH1750	Temp, humidity, and light sensing
Mist Nozzles + Solenoids	Automated fog and watering
Pi Camera	Image capture every hour
